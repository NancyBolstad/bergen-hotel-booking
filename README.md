# Hotel Booking Website

A local tourism agency in Bergen is launching a new website called ‘Holidaze’ for visitors to the
area to be able to find hotels, B&Bs and guesthouses, and for the accommodation owners to
receive enquiries.

The project requires you to create the visitor side of the website where users can search
accommodation and make enquiries, as well as the administration side where properties can be
added, and enquiries managed.

You will be provided a PHP scaffold to work with which will create and update JSON files you
can use as data. You can view the files at https://github.com/Noroff-Education/project-exam-2.

## Requirements for the Website

### Visitor Side
- Home page.
- Search bar typeahead (auto dropdown with hotel names that match what has been
typed).
- A results page with all hotels.
- The hotel specific page which displays all details about the hotel.
- An enquiry page either as a modal or a separate page.
- A contact page (different to the enquiry page) which goes to the admin for Holidaze.

### Admin side
- Simulate a login section (you can make use of localStorage).
- The list of enquiries, contact messages and establishments should be listed here. New enquiries and contact messages will appear when a user submits the forms.
- The admin can create a new establishment via a form.

### Recommended Process
Week 1 and 2: Planning and Design
Week 3 to 6: Coding
Week 7: Bug Fixing

## Level 1 Process
- Start by planning out the project. Develop a Gantt chart, a functional specification and a
wireframe.
- Next begin your research of likely users and browse competitor websites for ideas.
- Create a style guide.
- Build an Adobe XD prototype.
- Go through all supplied files and go over the README to understand how the code
integrates and generates JSON files for you to work with.
- Start coding in one of Vue or React.
- Use Sass or another CSS-preprocessor if you are not using Styled Components, CSS
Modules or similar.
- Once you’ve finished development, start looking for bugs and ensure the site functions
well on all viewports.
- Ask another student to look over your code and ask them if they can see how it might
be better implemented. This is important to get an outside view on your code. Please
attach this feedback to your report.
- Perform any refactoring that may be necessary.
